<h2>Questions</h2>

<ol>

<li><p>Assume you are comparing three different algorithms to solve some problem
and you have determined the worst-case time equations for each:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Algorithm 1: <tt>T(N) = N<sup>2</sup> + N + 20</tt></li>
    <li>Algorithm 2: <tt>T(N) = 1000N + 496</tt></li>
    <li>Algorithm 3: <tt>T(N) = 20Nlog<sub>2</sub>N + 3N + 5</tt></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Answer the following questions</b> regarding these three algorithms.</p>
<ol type="a">
    <li>What is the worst-case time complexity (Big-O) for each algorithm?</li>
    <li>Which algorithm has the lowest worst-case time complexity?</li>
    <li>Should the algorithm with the lowest order of complexity always be used?
    <b>Briefly</b> explain why or why not.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<br>

<li><p>Suppose the <tt>DblListnode&lt;E&gt;</tt> class is implemented as in the <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~skrentny/cs367-common/readings/Linked-Lists/index.html">readings</a>. The following class implements the <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~cs367-1/resources/examples/ListADT.html">ListADT</a> using a circular doubly-linked chain of nodes:</p>
<dir><pre><code>
public class CircularDblLinkedList&lt;E&gt; implements ListADT&lt;E&gt; {

    // Reference to the first node (position 0) of a circular doubly-linked
    // chain of nodes. Recall that the next reference of the last node
    // references the first node and the prev reference of the first node
    // references the last node making the chain of nodes circular.
    private DblListnode&lt;E&gt; items;
    // The number of items in the list
    private int numItems;

    public CircularDblLinkedList() {
        // Initially the list is empty
        items = null;
        numItems = 0;
    }

    // Return the item at position pos if pos is valid, otherwise throw
    // IndexOutOfBoundsException. This method traverses the fewest nodes
    // possible while locating the node at pos.
    public E get(int pos) {
        // IMPLEMENT THIS
    }
}
</code></pre></dir>

<p><b>Complete the <tt>get()</tt> method</tt> according to its
specification.</b> For full credit, your solution
<ul>
    <li>must locate the node at <tt>pos</tt> in the most efficient manner
    possible (i.e., call <tt>getNext()</tt> and <tt>getPrev()</tt> as few times
    as possible);</li>
    <li>must not modify the <tt>DblListnode</tt> class, the
    <tt>CircularDblLinkedList</tt> class, or any method or field declarations
    therein, except the body of the <tt>get()</tt> method;</li>
    <li>must not change the contents or ordering of the nodes in the list during
    execution.</li>
</ul></p></li>
<br>

<li><p><b>Briefly answer the following questions assuming the list has N nodes.</b> Full credit is given for concise answers.</p>
<ol type="a">
    <li>What is the exact worst-case number of <tt>getNext()</tt> and
    <tt>getPrev()</tt> calls required to locate a node in your implementation of
    <tt>get()</tt> from Question 2?</li>
    <li>What is the worst-case time (Big-O) of your implementation?</li>
    <li>Suppose we had used a singly linked list instead of a doubly linked
    list. What would be the exact worst-case number of <tt>getNext()</tt>
    calls required to locate a node in this case?</li>
    <li>What would be the worst-case time (Big-O) in the singly linked
    case?</li>
    <li>When is each implementation better than the other? Is one choice always
    best?</li>
