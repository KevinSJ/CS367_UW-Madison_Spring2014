<!-- QUESTION 2 -->
<li><p>Consider the following implementation of a node in a <a
    href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~skrentny/cs367-common/readings/Trees/repTrees.html">general
    tree</a>:
<dir><pre><code>
class Treenode&lt;T&gt; {
    // *** fields ***
    private T data;
    // assume ListADT&lt;E&gt; implements Iterable&lt;E&gt;
    private ListADT&lt;Treenode&lt;T&gt;&gt; children;

    // *** constructor ***
    public Treenode(T d) {
        data = d;
        children = new LinkedList&lt;Treenode&lt;T&gt;&gt;(); //NOTE use of LinkedList
    }

    // *** accessors ***
    public T getData() { return data; }
    public ListADT&lt;Treenode&lt;T&gt;&gt; getChildren() { return children; }
}
</code></pre></dir>
Note that you should assume <tt>ListADT&lt;E&gt;</tt> implements
<tt>Iterable&lt;E&gt;</tt>.
</p>

<p><b>Complete the <tt>countLeaves()</tt> method</b> according to its
specification. For full credit, your solution
<ul>
    <li>must not modify the tree;</li>
    <li>must make efficient use of data structures (note <tt>LinkedList</tt>
    is used to store child references); and</li>
    <li>must not be more than 15 lines of code and may be fewer.</li>
</ul>
<dir><pre><code>
// Returns the number of leaves in the tree rooted at n.
// Precondition: n is not null.
public static &lt;T&gt; int countLeaves(Treenode&lt;T&gt; n) {
</code></pre></dir>
</p>
</li>
<br>

<!-- QUESTION 3 -->
<li><p>Consider the following implementation of a binary tree node:
<dir><pre><code>
class BinaryTreenode<T> {
    // *** fields ***
    private T data;
    private BinaryTreenode&lt;T&gt; leftChild;
    private BinaryTreenode&lt;T&gt; rightChild;

    // *** constructor ***
    public BinaryTreenode(T d, BinaryTreenode&lt;T&gt; left, BinaryTreenode&lt;T&gt; right) {
        data = d;
        leftChild = left;
        rightChild = right;
    }

    // *** accessors ***
    public BinaryTreenode&lt;T&gt; getLeft() { return leftChild; }
    public BinaryTreenode&lt;T&gt; getRight() { return rightChild; }

    // *** mutators ***
    public setLeft(BinaryTreenode&lt;T&gt; left) { leftChild = left; }
    public setRight(BinaryTreenode&lt;T&gt; right) { rightChild = right; }
}
</code></pre></dir>
Imagine that we are using this code as part of a larger program, and this
larger program needs to save its state from time to time, or share its data with
another program. In either case, we need to be able to save the structure of the
tree in such a way that another program (or the same program at a later time) can
reconstruct the tree exactly as it was. The process of converting a data
structure into such a format is called <i>serialization</i>.</p>

<p>Suppose we have an interface, <tt>Serializer&lt;T&gt;</tt>, which defines a means
of serializing a single node. It has the following definition:
<dir><pre><code>
public interface Serializer&lt;T&gt; {
    // Given a node, stores the node's data in a format that can later be
    // reconstructed to recreate the node. Does NOT store child references.
    public void serializeNode(BinaryTreenode&lt;T&gt; n);
}
</code></pre></dir>
Any class which implements <tt>Serializer&lt;T&gt;</tt> provides a means of saving or
transmitting a single <tt>BinaryTreenode&lt;T&gt;</tt> instance.</p>

<p>Suppose we've implemented the following method:
<dir><pre><code>
// Serializes an individual node in the tree, recursively serializing
// children in a pre-order traversal of the tree.
public static &lt;T&gt; void serialize(BinaryTreenode&lt;T&gt; n, Serializer&lt;T&gt; serializer) {
    serializer.serializeNode(n);
    if (n != null) {
        serialize(n.getLeft(), serializer);
        serialize(n.getRight(), serializer);
    }
}
</code></pre></dir>
</p>
<p>Suppose also we have written a class <tt>IntSerializer implements
    Serializer&lt;Integer&gt;</tt> which serializes
<tt>BinaryTreenode&lt;Integer&gt;</tt> instances. The <tt>IntSerializer</tt> class
simply prints out the data of each node, followed by a comma and a space, if the
node is not <tt>null</tt>. If the node is <tt>null</tt>, it prints out
<tt>null</tt>, followed by a comma and a space.  <tt>IntSerializer</tt> assumes
that no data in the binary tree is <tt>null</tt>.</p>

<p>For example, suppose the binary tree looks like this:
<dir><pre><code>
1
 \
  3
 / \
2   4
</code></pre></dir>
Then, if <tt>root</tt> is a reference to the root of this tree, serializing it
using <tt>serialize(root, new IntSerializer())</tt> would produce the output:
<dir><pre><code>
1, null, 3, 2, null, null, 4, null, null, 
</code></pre></dir>
</p>

<p><b>Answer the following questions</b> regarding the <tt>serialize()</tt>
method and <tt>IntSerializer</tt> class.
<ol type="a">
    <li>What is the output of <tt>serialize(root, new IntSerializer())</tt> if

<!-- QUESTION 4 -->
<li><p>The reverse of serialization is <i>deserialization</i>: given the
serialized representation of the binary tree, reconstruct the original tree. In
parts (c) and (d) of the previous question, you deserialized trees serialized by the
<tt>serialize()</tt> method and <tt>IntSerializer</tt> class. In this problem,
you will implement code to do this.</p>

<p>First, we define the following interface:
<dir><pre><code>
public interface Deserializer&lt;T&gt; {
    // Returns BinaryTreenode&lt;T&gt; instances in the order in which they were
    // serialized (i.e., FIFO). The returned BinaryTreenode&lt;T&gt; instances
    // have their left and right child references set to null.  Throws
    // NoSuchElementException if called again after all serialized nodes have
    // been returned.
    public BinaryTreenode&lt;T&gt; deserializeNextNode();
}
</code></pre></dir>
Suppose we've also written a class <tt>IntDeserializer implements
    Deserializer&lt;Integer&gt;</tt> which is the complement to
<tt>IntSerializer</tt> in the question above. Given the output of <tt>serialize(new
    IntSerializer())</tt>, it returns <tt>BinaryTreenode&lt;Integer&gt;</tt>
instances in the same order they were serialized. However, note that each
returned node's child references are initialized to <tt>null</tt>; you will need
to reconstruct the relationships between the nodes returned by
<tt>IntDeserializer</tt>. For example, with an <tt>IntDeserializer</tt> instance
instantiated with the output
<dir><pre><code>
1, null, 3, 2, null, null, 4, null, null, 
</code></pre></dir>
from the example in the previous question, subsequent calls to
<tt>deserializeNextNode()</tt> would <i>effectively</i> iterate over the array
<dir><pre><code>
[new BinaryTreenode&lt;Integer&gt;(1, null, null),
 null,
 new BinaryTreenode&lt;Integer&gt;(3, null, null),
 new BinaryTreenode&lt;Integer&gt;(2, null, null),
 null,
 null,
 new BinaryTreenode&lt;Integer&gt;(4, null, null),
 null,
 null]
</code></pre></dir>
</p>

<p>
The <tt>deserialize()</tt> method has the following specification:
<dir><pre><code>
    // If the next node returned by the deserializer is null, returns null.
    // Otherwise, returns the subtree rooted at that node, reconstructed
    // recursively.
    // Precondition: deserializer is not null.
    private static &lt;T&gt; BinaryTreenode&lt;T&gt; deserialize(Deserializer&lt;T&gt; deserializer) {
        // IMPLEMENT THIS
</code></pre></dir>
</p>

<p><b>Complete the recursive <tt>deserialize()</tt> method.</b> Part of the
grade for this question will be based on how well your recursive solution is
coded. Your solution should not be more than 15 lines of code and may be
fewer. You should NOT attempt to catch <tt>NoSuchElementException</tt>; a
correct implementation will not cause <tt>deserializeNextNode()</tt> to throw
<tt>NoSuchElementException</tt>. You do NOT need to implement
<tt>IntDeserializer</tt>, which you should assume works as described above.</p></li>
