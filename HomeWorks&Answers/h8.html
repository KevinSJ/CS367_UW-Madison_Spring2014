<h2>Questions</h2>

<ol>

<!-- QUESTION 1 -->
<li><p><b>Answer the following questions</b> about a <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~skrentny/cs367-common/readings/Trees/intro.html">binary tree</a> with
N nodes. Give exact answers, i.e. not using Big-O notation. (Recall that a
binary tree is <b>balanced</b> if, for every node, the height of the left or
right subtree is at most one more than the height of the other subtree.
Equivalently, the height of the tree is as small as possible.)</p>
<p><i>Hint:</i>You may find the following functions useful in expressing your
answers: <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions">floor and
ceiling functions</a></p>
    <ol type="a">
    <li>What is the maximum height of the tree?</li>
    <li>What is the maximum number of leaves?</li>
    <li>What is the maximum height of the tree if it is balanced?</li>
    <li>What is the maximum number of leaves if the tree is balanced?</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<br>

<!-- QUESTION 2 -->
<li><p><b>Answer the following questions</b> about a standard <a
    href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~skrentny/cs367-common/readings/Binary-Search-Trees/index.html">binary search
    tree</a>.</p>
<ol type="a">
    <li>Show the binary search tree that results from inserting the following
    sequence of integers into a tree that is initially empty:
    <dir><pre>
    4, 2, 5, 7, 1, 6, 3, 8
    </pre></dir></li>
    <li>Show the binary search tree that results from inserting the following
    sequence of integers into a tree that is initially empty:
    <dir><pre>
    8, 13, 12, 6, 10, 5, 11, 3, 4
    </pre></dir></li>
    <li>Show the binary search tree that results from deleting 2 from the tree
    in part (a).</li>
    <li>Show the binary search tree that results from deleting 8 from the tree
    in part (b).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<br>

<!-- QUESTION 3 -->
<li><p>Suppose you are implementing a data structure to store an index for a
directory of names. Each name is located on a particular page, identified by an
integer page number. You can imagine that each name has some associated data,
such as contact information, but that is not relevant to the index: you just
need to perform fast lookups of the page that a particular name should be found
on. The names are arranged in lexicographical order.
</p>

<p>For example, suppose the the directory looks like the following:
<dir><pre>
Page 1
--------------------------------
Adams
Arthur
Buchanan
Bush

Page 2
--------------------------------
Carter
Cleveland
Clinton
Coolidge
Eisenhower
</pre></dir>
Note that there are no duplicates! Each name appears at most once.</p>

<p>The index lookup, which you will implement, should work as follows. Given a
name, it returns the page on which that name should be found, <i>if it is in the
directory at all</i>. That is, the index does NOT keep track of every name in
the directory, but it can determine which page a name might be found on. It does
this by storing the first and last name found on each page. In order to
determine which page a supplied name should be found on, it finds a page such
that the supplied name occurs lexicographically between the first and last names
on the page. In the above example, If we were to look up the name "Adams", we
should find that it is located on page 1, if it's in the directory (which it
is). If we were to look up "Davis", we would find that it should be located on
page 2, if it's in the directory (which it is not). If we were to look up
"Campbell" we would find that it is not in the directory: "Campbell" should
occur after "Bush" and before "Carter", but there is no page which could contain
this name.</p>

<p>The index is implemented as a Java class. It has the following (partial)
implementation:
<dir><pre><code>
import java.util.NoSuchElementException;

public class Index {
    Page root;
    
    // Returns the page number on which name should be found, or throws
    // NoSuchElementException if name cannot be located on any page in the
    // index. A name should be found on a given page if it is lexicographically
    // between the first and last name contained on that page (inclusive), as
    // determined by the compareTo() method of the String class.
    // Precondition: name is not null
    public int lookupName(String name) {
        if (root == null) {
            throw new NoSuchElementException();
        }
        return root.lookupName(name);
    }

    // ...
}
</code></pre></dir>
You do not need to modify the <tt>Index</tt> class. The following is a template
for the <tt>Page</tt> class which <tt>Index</tt> uses to store data about pages.
<dir><pre><code>
import java.util.NoSuchElementException;

public class Page {
    // PART B: ADD PRIVATE FIELDS
    
    public int lookupName(String name) {
        // PART C: IMPLEMENT THIS
    }
    
    // ... You do NOT need to implement the remainder of the class
}
</code></pre></dir>
</p>

<p>Your task is to design the <tt>Page</tt> class and implement its
<tt>lookupName()</tt> method. Besides correctness, the most important goal is
speed. If the index contains N pages, your design should support worst-case
lookups in time O(log N) under certain conditions, which you will describe
below. You may assume that
<ul>
    <li>names in the index are ordered lexicographically according to the
    compareTo() method of the String class,</li>
    <li>each name appears on at most one page, and</li>
    <li>the directory is static: names will not be added or removed</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b>Part A: Briefly describe the structure</b> of the index by answering the
following questions:
<ol type="i">
    <li>Which data structure studied in class does your index most closely
    resemble? (Be specific.)</li>
    <li>What data about a page must each <tt>Page</tt> instance store?</li>
    <li>How are <tt>Page</tt> instances arranged relative to one another? (Be
    specific.)</li>
    <li>What must be true about your data structure in order to achieve O(log N)
    worst-case lookup times? (You do NOT need to enforce this condition, just
    describe it.)</li>
</ol>
Full credit is given for concise answers; each answer should be one sentence.
</p>

<p><b>Part B: List the private fields</b> of your <tt>Page</tt> class. Use
correct Java syntax and descriptive names. You may not use any type other
than <tt>Page</tt>, <tt>String</tt>, or any primitive type. You may not use
arrays, lists, or other data structures. In order to receive full credit, you
must use at most six fields (and may use fewer) and you <b>MUST</b> use
a descriptive name AND provide a short (one line) descriptive comment for each
field.

<p><b>Part C: Implement <tt>lookupName()</tt></b>. In order to receive full
credit, your implementation
<ul>
    <li>must return the page number on which a name should be found, if
    any;</li>
    <li>must throw <tt>NoSuchElementException</tt> if no page exists such that
    the given name occurs lexicographically between the page's first and last
    names;</li>
    <li>must complete lookup operations in O(log N) time, where N is the number
    of pages in the index (assuming the condition you described in Part A);
    and</li>
    <li>must be at most 25 lines of code, and may be fewer.</li>
</ul>
Note that you do NOT need to implement the constructor or a means of
initializing your data structure. You may assume that it has been created as you
described in Part A.
</p><p>
<i>Hint:</i> if the current <tt>Page</tt> doesn't contain <tt>name</tt>, make a
recursive call.
