<h2>Questions</h2>

<ol>

<!-- QUESTION 1 -->
<li><p>Consider the following <i>directed</i> <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~skrentny/cs367-common/readings/Graphs/index.html">graph</a>, which is
given in adjacency list form:</p>
<dir><pre>
1 : 2, 5, 7
2 : 3, 4, 5
3 : 1
4 : 3, 6
5 : 8
6 : 1, 4, 9
7 : 2, 9
8 : 6
9 : 3
</pre></dir>
<p>(I.e., the first line says that the graph contains a directed edge from node
1 to node 2, an edge from 1 to 5, and so on.)</p>

<p><b>Part A:</b>
<ol type="i">
    <li>Show the order that nodes are visited for breadth-first search
    on the graph above starting at 1 and visiting successors in increasing
    numerical order (i.e., follow the CS 367 conventions).
<!--
 (e.g., if a node has edges to vertices 3, 7, and 9, your search should visit
    node 3 before 7 and 7 before 9).
-->
    </li>
    <li>Give the corresponding BFS spanning tree in adjacency list form.</li>
</ol></p>

<p><b>Part B:</b>
<ol type="i">
    <li>Repeat part A but for depth-first search, again visiting successors in increasing numerical order.</li>
    <li>Give the corresponding DFS spanning tree in adjacency list form.</li>
</li>
</ol></p>
<br>

<!-- QUESTION 2 -->
<li><p>Consider the following directed acyclic graph (DAG) given in adjacency
matrix form:</p>
<dir><pre>
     1 2 3 4 5 6
   +------------
 1 | 0 0 0 0 1 0
 2 | 0 0 0 0 1 0
 3 | 1 0 0 1 0 1
 4 | 1 1 0 0 0 0
 5 | 0 0 0 0 0 0
 6 | 1 0 0 0 0 0
</pre></dir>
<p>(I.e., the third row says there is a directed edge from node 3 to node 1,
from 3 to 4, and so on.)</p>
<p><b>Give a topological numbering</b> of the nodes in the above graph.</p>
</li>
<br>

<!-- QUESTION 3 -->
<li>
<p>Suppose you're writing a program that handles images, perhaps a photo
editing program or a robotic vision system. We can represent an image as a 2D
array of pixels, where each element of the array gives the color of the pixel at
that location. For simplicity, we will assume that we are working with
black-and-white images. In this case, each pixel can be specified by a single
<tt>double</tt> value that gives the <i>intensity</i> of that pixel: if the
intensity of a pixel is 0.0, it is completely black, and if it is 1.0, it is
completely white. (Intensities are always between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.)</p>

<p>For example, the following array represents an image that is completely
white on the left, gray in the middle, and completely black on the right:</p>
<dir><pre>
                 Columns
        0    1    2    3    4    5
     +-----------------------------
   0 |1.00 1.00 0.50 0.50 0.00 0.00 
R    |
o  1 |1.00 1.00 0.50 0.50 0.00 0.00 
w    |
s  2 |1.00 1.00 0.50 0.50 0.00 0.00 
     |
   3 |1.00 1.00 0.50 0.50 0.00 0.00 
  
</pre></dir>
<p>Note that indexing starts at (0,0) in the upper-left corner of the image, and
is specified as (<i>row</i>, <i>column</i>). The <i>height</i> of the image is
the number of rows and the <i>width</i> of the image is the number of columns.
In this example, the height is 4 and the width is 6.</p>

<p>Your task is to find contiguous regions within the image. This might be
useful in a photo editing program to allow a user to click on an object, say a
white ball on a gray background, and have the program select the entire ball but
none of the background. Or it might be useful in a vision system to identify the
shape of obstacles or recognize characters in text. We will call such contiguous
regions <i>segments</i>.</p>

<p>Define segments as follows. A set of pixels is a segment if for each pixel in
the set there is a path (a sequence of pixels neighboring each other) to each
other pixel in the segment such that each pixel in the path is also in the
segment. At each step on the path, the difference between the intensity of one
pixel on the path and the intensity of the next pixel on that path must be at
most some threshold.  The neighbors of a pixel are the four pixels immediately
above, below, left, and right.</p>

<p>For example, the following image has two segments when the threshold is
0.1:</p>
<dir><pre>
     0    1  
  +---------
 0|1.00 0.00 
  |
 1|0.90 0.80 
</pre></dir>
<p>The first segment contains the three pixels at (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1). The
second segment contains the black pixel at (0,1). If the threshold is set to
1.0, all pixels are in one segment; if the threshold is 0.05, each pixel is in
its own segment. Note that if the pixels at (1,0) and (1,1) were swapped, the
image would have three segments for any threshold less than 0.2 and at least
0.1, because (0,0) and (1,1) are not neighbors.</p>

<p>The program you're working on represents images using <tt>Image</tt> and
<tt>Pixel</tt> classes, which have the following (partial) implementations:</p>
<dir><pre><code>

// Represents an individual pixel in the image.
public class Pixel {
    // Returns the row of this pixel as an int. Rows are indexed from zero,
    // starting at the top of the image.
    public int getRow() { ... }
    
    // Returns the column of this pixel as an int. Columns are indexed from
    // zero, starting on the left of the image.
    public int getCol() { ... }
    
    // Returns the intensity of this pixel as a double. The intensity is always
    // between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.
    public double getIntensity() { ... }
    
    // Returns an array of this pixel's neighbors. The length of the array is
    // between 2 and 4: pixels on the edges of the image have three neighbors
    // and pixels in the corners have two neighbors. Neighbors are not
    // guaranteed to be returned in any particular order.
    public Pixel[] getNeighbors() { ... }
}


// Represents an image as a collection of Pixel objects.
public class Image {
    // Array of pixels in the image. pixelData[r][c] is the Pixel object
    // representing the pixel at row r and column c.
    private Pixel[][] pixelData;

    // The width and height of this image.
    private int width, height;

    // ...

    // Returns the segment of the image containing the pixel at (row,col) using
    // threshold. 
    // Preconditions: 0 &lt;= row &lt; height, 0 &lt;= col &lt; width,
    // 0.0 &lt;= threshold &lt;= 1.0
    public Set&lt;Pixel&gt; getSegment(int row, int col, double threshold) {
        // IMPLEMENT THIS
    }
}

implementation

    <li>must not modify the <tt>Pixel</tt> or <tt>Image</tt> class, except the
    body of <tt>getSegment</tt>;</li>
    <li>must use only primitive types, arrays (including 2D arrays),
